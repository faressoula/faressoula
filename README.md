Hi, I’m @faressoula currently pursuing an associate of science with an emphasis in computer science and software engineering, which is transferable to a bachelor of science in data science at the University of Texas at Dallas.
I’m particularly interested in data science and machine learning. 
I spend most of my time functioning with complex computer algorithms and solving problems.
